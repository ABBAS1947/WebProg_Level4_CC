      <h2>Gameplay & Features</h2>
      <p>The Evil Within delivers a chilling gameplay experience that combines elements of stealth, survival, and psychological horror. Players assume the role of Detective Sebastian Castellanos, who must navigate a nightmarish world crawling with grotesque enemies and environmental traps.

Resource management is key — ammo is scarce, and healing items are limited. You must make every bullet count and use stealth whenever possible to avoid direct confrontation. The game also allows for crafting and upgrading weapons using green gel found throughout levels.

Combat is intense and brutal. Enemies are relentless, and boss battles require careful strategy, patience, and quick reflexes. Players can use traps set around the environment to their advantage, or avoid them entirely for a more cautious approach.

As the game progresses, the world becomes more twisted. Hallways stretch endlessly, rooms change shape, and reality becomes more unstable. These elements create a disorienting and suspenseful atmosphere that keeps players on edge.

In addition to its gameplay mechanics, The Evil Within also introduces safe rooms — brief moments of reprieve where players can save progress and reflect on journal entries, offering deeper insights into the story and characters.

Whether you're sneaking past enemies in a burning hospital, solving twisted puzzles in a haunted mansion, or fleeing a giant blood-soaked monster in the sewer, every moment in The Evil Within is designed to terrify and captivate.</p>
