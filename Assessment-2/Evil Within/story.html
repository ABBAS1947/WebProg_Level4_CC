      <h2>Storyline</h2>
      <p>The story begins with Detective Sebastian Castellanos and his partners responding to a distress call at Beacon Mental Hospital. Upon arriving, they discover a massacre — patients and staff are brutally murdered. But what starts as a crime scene investigation quickly descends into horror.

Sebastian is pulled into a nightmarish alternate reality ruled by a malevolent force known as Ruvik. Time and space lose all meaning, and Sebastian is forced to navigate a hellish landscape filled with traps, monsters, and twisted memories. As he uncovers more about the mysterious STEM system that links minds together, he realizes he's not just fighting to escape — he’s fighting to retain his sanity.

Driven by guilt and grief from past trauma, Sebastian’s journey through the decaying world becomes a psychological trial. Every enemy and distorted setting reflects deeper emotional scars. In the end, what’s real and what’s illusion becomes impossible to tell.</p>
